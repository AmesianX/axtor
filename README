    AST Extraction Framework for LLVM (axtor)    
------------------------------------------------

author: Simon Moll
date: 28-02-2011




BUILD REQUIREMENTS
* LLVM 2.8
* Clang 1.5

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
1.) run "make"



TOOLS
"opencl [TEST]"
	will run the OpenCL test case in folder "test/opencl/[TEST]". Output is written to "[TEST].cl".

"glsl [TEST]"
	will run the GLSL test case in folder "test/glsl/[TEST]". The shaders are written to "[TEST].frag" and [TEST].vert".




AMD STREAM SDK - OpenCL TEST CASES
The AMD Stream SDK can be downloaded from http://developer.amd.com/gpu/AMDAPPSDK/downloads/Pages/default.aspx (available as of 28.02.2011).
The OpenCL-files that axtor generates from the OpenCL test cases that correspond to examples of that SDK can be used to replace the original files shipped with the SDK.
The kernel function "compute" needs to be named according to the name used in the SDK test case. (e.g. "nbody_sim" for the NBody simulation case)

COMPARISON OF OPTIMIZATION LEVELS   

The optimization levels used for compiling the test cases to LLVM-Bitcode modules can be changed by adapting the "LLVMCC" variable in both the test/opencl/Testmake or
the test/glsl/Testmake Makefile.
