##### Requirements #####
This will, most likely, only work ..:
 * on Linux,
 because the driver is making assumptions about the whereabouts of
 temporary-files, needs "sed" and requires LD_PRELOAD to be loaded.

 * with a patched Clang installation.
 Apply the "clang_opencl_patch_r<YourRevision>.patch" patch found
 in "patches/" on clang.
 
 * with the two other tools: "oclang.sh" and "extractor"
 
 
##### Known Issues #####
As we are playing some funny games with the linker, the whole act
can fail, if the wrapped driver is also linking against LLVM/exporting
LLVM symbols. This is due to ld-symbol look-up semantics.
Does not currently work with the packetizer.


##### Usage #####
First, make sure that LLVM_PATH is set (explanation below).
Run an executable using OpenCL with the following command line:

	LD_PRELOAD=<PathToThisLibrary.so> ./<Executable>
	
	
Try simple OpenCL demos to verify your installation.


##### Environment variables #####
LLVM_PATH (required)
	installation path of the LLVM binaries.
	
AXTOR_CLANG_OPTIONS (optional)
	additional options passed to the clang.
	 
AXTOR_OPT_OPTIONS (optional)
	parameters for opt.
	For portability apply your transformation here, instead
	of patching the wrapper itself.
